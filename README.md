# GEE-Burn-Severity-dNBR-MODIS-FIRMS-Validation-Horse-River-Fire-2016-Fort-McMurray
Computes pre- and post-fire NBR from Landsat 8 SR (C2 L2), then dNBR = preNBR − postNBR to map burn severity (1–5 classes) for the 2016 Horse River wildfire. Validates burned/unburned results using MODIS MCD64A1 (BurnDate>0) and cross-checks with FIRMS active fires. Exports GeoTIFFs + area stats.
